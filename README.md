# Ant-Epidemic-Model
These scripts are for simulating an agent-based model described in "Socially driven negative feedback regulates activity and energy use in ant colonies" by Porfiri et al. 
"Agent based model.nb" can be used to simulate the model using the algorithm from the manuscript and plots the results. Neighbors are selected for the activation process using a switching Erdos-Renyi network. 
"Agent based model -  pairwise.nb" can be used to simulate the model where each agent randomly selects a single neighbor for the activation process at each time step.
